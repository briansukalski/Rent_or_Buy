# Rent_or_Buy

The purpose of this project is to build an app that will allow a user to determine whether renting or buying a home will be a better financial decision over a set period of time.

Factors that will be considered: time of ownership, mortgage duration, mortgage interest rate, down payment amount, home value, mortgage insurance rate, HOA fees, property taxes, expected rate of property value increase, resale tax, time value of money, expected rate of rent increase, and renter's insurance.

I plan to accomplish the calculations by building a comparison function with many optional parameters for the above data. I plan to find some relevant APIs to fill in any omitted arguments.
